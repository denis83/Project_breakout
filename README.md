####################################### WELCOME ####################################################

Thank you for trying out our Breakout game.
It was created by Kevin DiMaria and Denis Pelevin.

######################################## IMPORTANT ##################################################
This particular project was developed using Qt IDE, so if you dont have it installed on your computer it will not compile.

However, Qt Creator is free to download and if you don't have it yet it is a very powerful software development tool and we highly recomend it. To install QtCreator just run

	sudo apt-get install qtcreator


If you already have Qt installed just run "qmake" and "make" commands to compile.

######################################## Game play #####################################################

Game itself is not very complicated.
	spacebar 			- start the game on each level
	left, right arrow keys 		- control paddle
	p				- pause/resume game
	esc				- quit game

There are 3 levels total and you only get 1 life.

Enjoy!
